# QSLRM  
**Quantum Scientific Learning & Reproducibility Manager**

QSLRM is a lightweight framework for managing, tracking, and reproducing
computational experiments in quantum simulation and scientific machine learning.

It is designed to reduce experiment drift, improve reproducibility, and
standardize result logging across research workflows.

---

## Motivation

Computational research in quantum physics and ML often suffers from:
- Poor experiment traceability
- Inconsistent configuration management
- Lost parameter settings and results
- Irreproducible simulation pipelines

QSLRM provides a structured yet minimal solution to these problems.

## Core Features

- Experiment configuration tracking
- Structured result logging
- Backend support for analytics and storage
- Separation of frontend, backend, and database layers
- Designed for research-scale (not enterprise) workflows
